    "### Semi-Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The training set you feed to the algorithm is partially labeled. Most semi-supervised learning algorithms are combinatinos of supervised and unsupervised algo's.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, deep belief networks (DBN's) are based on unsupervised components called restricuted Boltzmann Machines (RBM's) stacked on top of one another. RBM's are trained sequentially in an unsupervised manner, and then the whole system is fine-tuned using supervised learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning system (e.g agent) can observe the environment, select and peform actions, and get rewards in return (or penalties in the form of negative rewards). It must then learn by itself what is the best strategy (e.g a policy) to get the most rewards over time. A policy defines waht action the agent should choose when it is given a situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, many robots implement RL to learn how to walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning system is incapable of learning incrementally - it must be trained using all available data which generally can take a substantial amount of time. Given the computing resources, the system is generally trained offline before being launched into production.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Online Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning system is trained incrementally by feeding it data instances sequentially either individually or in small groups called mini-batches. \n",
    "\n",
    "Online learning is great for systems that receive data sa. continous flow (e.g stock prices) and need to adapt to change rapidly or autonomously. Online learning systems rely on a learning rate, which tells the algo how fast to adapt to the new data and disregard the old data."
